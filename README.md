#Abstract

In our project, we aimed to use state-of-the-
art language models to identify disaster-related
tweets for rapid response. Employing BERT
and ELMo models, we leveraged the contex
tual nature of these models to classify tweets
accurately. The project included an exploration
of added features such as length, number of
unique words, stop words, characters, punc-
tuation, sentiment scores and etc. The find-
ings suggest a slight edge of the BERT model
over ELMo, with BERT having an F1-score of
0.84768 compared to ELMoâ€™s 0.7916 without
features and 0.77566 with features. The supe-
rior performance of BERT could potentially be
attributed to its bi-directional nature and the
inclusion of additional features in the model.
This project is created for NLP course assignment.
